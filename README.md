# Bikelane
Business 5100 Final Project
Abstract: This paper looks at the presence of bike lanes within the city of Los Angeles and how their presence could offer positive economic benefits to businesses. City wide shutdowns initiated in March of 2020 acted as a demand shock to local businesses.  Over the next two years, businesses struggled to keep the doors open.  This paper will explore the possibility of bicycle infrastructure playing a role in supporting/insulating local businesses from closure and the potential positive economic impact.  Data for this topic will be provided by Los Angeles City Open Data and SAP will be used for all visuals, maps, timelines and charts. Additionally, research findings will be compared to that of the Transportation Research and Education Center at Portland State Universityâ€™s study on Bike Lanes and their positive economic impact in cities.
